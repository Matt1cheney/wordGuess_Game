// we need to make a word guess game!

// we will need to loop through possible words to guess.
//   make a js file to list possible words.


// we will need to use inquirer to guess a letter.


// we need to set a remaining guesses count.

// if a letter is wrong, we need to tell them its wrong and 
// subtract remaining guesses.

// if a letter is correct we need to show that they were correct and then show
// all of the instances the letter was used.

// once they have guessed all the letters we need to run a winner
// prompt and then end the game.

// if they run out of guesses we need to run a loser prompt and end the game


// ask if they want to play again!
